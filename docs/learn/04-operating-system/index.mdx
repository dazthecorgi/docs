# Operating System

Here we define the operating system layer of Quilibrium, in which we build a [Database Operating System](/docs/learn/operating-system/dbos) on the hypergraph database, realizing common OS primitives, such as a [File System](/docs/learn/operating-system/file-system), [Scheduler](/docs/learn/operating-system/scheduler), [IPC](/docs/learn/operating-system/ipc)-like equivalent, [Message Queueing](/docs/learn/operating-system/message-queues), [Control Key Management](/docs/learn/operating-system/key-management), then finally a [Universal Resource](/docs/learn/operating-system/universal-resources) pattern, in which we globally define resources, and unique instances of those resources, initially with an [Account](/docs/learn/operating-system/accounts) resource, which tracks the balance of individual holdersâ€™ network reward tokens, unifying the reward structure at the most base level of the protocol all the way up the architectural stack.
