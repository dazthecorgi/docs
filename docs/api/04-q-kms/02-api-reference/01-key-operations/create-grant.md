# CreateGrant

Creates a grant for a KMS key. A grant is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations.

## Description

A grant gives AWS principals long-term permissions to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. You can create a grant to allow a principal to use the KMS key in specified operations. You can also use a grant to allow the principal to delegate their grant permissions to other principals.
