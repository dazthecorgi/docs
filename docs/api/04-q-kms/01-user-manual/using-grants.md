# Using Grants

This guide explains how to use grants to delegate permissions in QKMS.

## Overview

Grants are an alternative to key policies for controlling access to your KMS keys. They allow you to delegate the use of your KMS keys to other principals under specific conditions.

## Understanding Grants

A grant is a policy instrument that allows you to:
- Delegate permissions to other principals
- Set specific conditions for key usage
- Control when and how the grant can be retired
