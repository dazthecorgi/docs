# UploadPart

Uploads a part in a multipart upload. See [UploadPart](../09-data-types/upload-part.md) for more details about the operation and its parameters.

## Description

The `UploadPart` operation uploads a part in a multipart upload. You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part.

:::note
- Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive.
- A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created.
- If you upload a new part using the same part number as a previously uploaded part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.
- Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.
- After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload.
- You can use SSE, but this means your uploaded data will be encrypted twice, once with the specified key, and again for storage.
:::

## Request Syntax

<ApiExample
  request={{
    method: "PUT",
    path: "/_ObjectKey_?partNumber=_PartNumber_&uploadId=_UploadId_",
    headers: {
      "Host": "_BucketName_.qstorage.quilibrium.com",
      "Content-Length": "_Length_",
      "Content-MD5": "_MD5_",
      "x-amz-expected-bucket-owner": "_OwnerAccountId_"
    }
  }}
  response={{}}
/>

The request body contains the part data to be uploaded.

## Request Parameters

### URI Parameters

<ParamsTable parameters={URI_PARAMETERS} />

### Headers

<ParamsTable parameters={HEADER_PARAMETERS} />
