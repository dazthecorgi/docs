# Object Versioning

This guide explains how to use object versioning in QStorage.

## Overview

Object versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your QStorage bucket.

## Versioning States

A bucket can be in one of three versioning states:
- Unversioned (default)
- Versioning-enabled
- Versioning-suspended
