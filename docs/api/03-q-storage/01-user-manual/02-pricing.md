# Pricing

QStorage pricing is based on two main components:

## Storage Pricing

Storage is billed on a per-gigabyte (GB) basis. The amount you pay depends on:
- The total volume of data stored in your QStorage buckets
- The duration for which your data is stored

## Request Pricing

In addition to storage costs, you are charged for requests made against your objects:
- **PUT, COPY, POST, LIST requests**: These operations are charged at one rate
- **GET and other retrieval requests**: These operations are charged at another rate
- **Data transfer**: Additional charges may apply for data transferred out of QStorage

The specific pricing details and rates are available on the Quilibrium pricing page in the QConsole.

### Cost Management Tips

To optimize your QStorage costs:
- Implement lifecycle policies to automatically transition or expire objects
- Use object tagging for detailed cost allocation and tracking
- Monitor your usage patterns to identify opportunities for optimization

## Payment Options

QStorage offers flexible payment options to accommodate different user preferences:

- **$QUIL**: Pay using Quilibrium's native token
- **$wQUIL**: Pay using wrapped QUIL tokens
- **$USDC**: Pay using USD Coin stablecoin, which will be converted to the network's $QUIL

You can select your preferred payment method when setting up your account or modify it later through your account settings. All pricing is denominated in USD, with conversions to crypto assets happening at the current market rate at the time of billing.
