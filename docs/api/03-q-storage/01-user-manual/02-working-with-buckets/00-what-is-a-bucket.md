# What is a Bucket?

A bucket is a repository for your data to live in.  You can think of it as a "folder" on your computer in which you find all your files in.  

Buckets regions in QStorage differ from that from AWS's S3 in the manner that all data is currently stored in the network, where the network is just one big region.

You can store however much data you want and billing is done per GB plus request counts.
