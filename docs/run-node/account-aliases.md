# Account Aliases

Account aliases are a local-only method of saving frequently used Account addresses.

This allows you to save an account like: 0xabcdefg12345hijk to something like 'john-doe'.

If you wish to save this address list, the list must be manually saved with your own backup solution.

See the [Alias commands](/docs/run-node/qclient/commands/alias) for more information.
