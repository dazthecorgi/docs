# Using the Node Service
Using a node service is not required to run the node application, but it makes life much easier for a long-lived software like the node application is.

## Commands

There are a few basic commands:

| **Command**          | **Syntax**                          | **Description**                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Start**            | `qclient node service start`        | Starts the node service if it is installed.  |
| **Stop**             | `qclient node service stop`         | Stops the node service if it is running.     |
| **Enable**           | `qclient node service enable`       | Enables the node service to start on boot.   |
| **Restart**          | `qclient node service restart`      | Restarts the node service.                   |
