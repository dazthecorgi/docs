# Create A New Keyset

A new keyset (also commonly called a "config") can be generated by running the command:

```bash
qclient node config create [name]
```

## Location
The keyset will be located in `~/.quilibrium/configs/[name]`

:::note
The `keys.yml` file will remain empty until it interacts with the network.
