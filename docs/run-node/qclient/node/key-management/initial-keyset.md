# Initial Keyset
When first running a node, if you do not have a default keyset defined, a set of keys will be auto-generated for you.

## Default Name
The default name for the auto-generated keyset will be `node-quickstart`

:::note
The initial keys.yml file will only contain a value of `null:` until the node has run and obtained key information from the network.
